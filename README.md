# Projekat-Soft-Computing
Project for Soft Computing (BSc of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Universiti of Novi Sad).

The aim of the project is to determine whether a person is drug-dependent or not based on a face line. 
Using a smart algorithm, I will extract facial lines and use them for KNN and SVM for classification. Then I will compare this algorithm with the classic HOG + KNN and HOG + SVM algorithms.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Machine that was used in the creation of the project was Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon 64-bit. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
python >= 3.6 (I used Python 3.6.5 Anaconda)
pip >= 18.1 (you can probably use a different version)
```

### Installing

A step by step guide to get a development env running

```
* Download the Repository from GitHub
* Open terminal in your Linux
* pip install all from requirements.txt
* Navigate to Repository file you just downloaded using terminal
* Run 'Projekat.py' and 'Projekat2.py' from terminal like this:
```
```
python Projekat.py chmod +x
```

If you want to open 'Projekat.ipynb' consult Jupiter Notebook (5.5.0) manual (or just Google like everybody else).

## Built With

* [Jupiter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - Open-source web application I used to write Python code.
